This is the code underlaying a research project conducted (initially) by Christopher Wahl while an undergraduate physics
major at the College at Brockport. For a more thorough understanding of the project itself, see the project writeup in
the Documentation folder.

Note:  The tools.plot package relies upon an installation og the Python 3 modified [Gnuplot-py](https://github.com/oblalex/gnuplot.py-py3k).
